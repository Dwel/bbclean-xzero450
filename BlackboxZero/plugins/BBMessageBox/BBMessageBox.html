								<p>To load BBCalendar you simply need to add the relative path of the plugin (from 
									your Blackbox directory) to the Blackbox configuration file
									<span>plugins.rc</span>
								(located in the Blackbox directory). For example, if you installed Blackbox 
								into c:\Blackbox, and BBCalendar.dll is located in c:\Blackbox\plugins\BBCalendar\, 
								you should add the line...
								<p><span>plugins\BBCalendar\BBCalendar.dll</span>
									<br>
									for when you are not loading the BBSlit plugin. Or...<br>
									<span>&plugins\BBCalendar\BBCalendar.dll</span>
									<br>
								for when loading it with or in the BBSlit plugin.
								<P>
								...to plugins.rc. Simple, eh? :) Make sure to note the '&' at the beginning of 
								the second load line.
								<p>You should also have a look at the
									<span>BBCalendar.rc</span>
								file&nbsp;after you load the plugin, in case there are any settings you would 
								want to customise. The file will be saved if there is no file found.&nbsp; You 
								can access this file by right clicking on the plugin and choosing the 
								"Settings" submenu, then choose&nbsp;"Edit Settings".&nbsp; These settings are 
								shown below.

              BBCalendar...</span></center>
											</td>
										</tr>
									</table>
								<p><b><u>Mouse Input</u></b>
								<p>
								Once the plugin is loaded,&nbsp;a few&nbsp;things can be done with a simple 
								click on the&nbsp;BBCalendar window.
								<p><span class="desc">Left 
            Click&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>none</span> <br>Left Click + Ctrl&nbsp;&nbsp;<span> &nbsp;none</span>&nbsp;<br>Double Left Click&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>&nbsp;Displays the Date/Time control panel item</span>&nbsp; <br>Middle 
            Click&nbsp;&nbsp;<FONT color="#777777">none</FONT> <br>Right 
            Click&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>Opens&nbsp;configuration 
            menu</span>&nbsp; <br>Right Click + 
            Ctrl&nbsp;&nbsp;<span> none</span> </span>
								<p><b><u>The Menu</u></b>
								<p>
								The plugin menu let's you change or select various things, and most should be 
								self-explanatory. However, there is one submenu worth mentioning - the 
								"Settings" submenu.
								<p>This submenu let's you "Save Settings" (current) to file, or "Reload Settings" 
									that you have edited. These are important because a) BBCalendar only writes 
									settings when you tell it to, or on plugin shutdown, and b) you do not need to 
									reconfigure bb4win in order to have BBCalendar reload settings from the
									<span>BBCalendar.rc</span>
								file.&nbsp; One more thing to note.&nbsp; If you change any of the settings, or 
								move the window, you may want to choose "Save Settings", otherwise when you 
								choose "Reload Settings" BBCalendar will go back to the last saved configuration. 
								When you change files manually from the .rc file and save them, always choose 
								"Reload Settings" so that BBCalendar will get the new settings.
								<p><b><u>Keyboard Input</u></b>
								<p>
								None.
								<p><b><u>Miscellaneous Notes</u></b>
								&nbsp;
								<P>
									You can now load BBCalendar in the BBSlit plugin, but you must use the '&' at the 
									beginning of your plugins.rc setting for loading BBCalendar.dll. Do not use the 
									'&' symbol if you are not loading bbslit.dll in the plugins.rc file. When 
									loaded with bbslit.dll and the '&' sybmbol for BBCalendar, you have the option of 
									setting it in and out of the slit at any time. Otherwise the BBCalendar.inSlit: 
									config setting has no effect when BBCalendar is not loaded with an '&' symbol.
									<br>
									<br>
									Everything centers perfect now. Alarm time can only be set in the rc file. Make 
									sure you reload the settings using the BBCalendar right click menu. If 
									BBCalendar.synchronize: false, then the .wav file will only be played once, 
									otherwise it will be played each time the animation recycles. Each frequency 
									setting effects the animation recycle count only for each respective alarm, not 
									how many times the .wav file is played for each alarm. However, the .wav file 
									will be played as many times as each of the respective frequency settings if 
									synchronize is true.
									<br>
									<br>
									NOTE: When switching from showing the seconds hand to not shownig the seconds 
									hand, the redraw timer for BBCalendar is set to one minute, so the minute hand 
									will not update until exactly one minute after you change the showSeconds 
									setting to false and then reload BBCalendar.
									<br>
									<br>
									TIP: If the .wav sound gets clipped(not played completely) everytime it plays 
									in synchronization with the animation, try lowering the animationFPS. This will 
									animate the alarm at a slower pace, giving more time for the .wav file to 
									complete it's sound.
									<br>
									<br>
									Also, if you wish for only play part of a .wav file to play each time it is 
									repeated, and then complete the .wav on the last alarm sound. Try increasing 
									the animationFPS and test to it to fine tune it to your liking.
									<br>
									<br>
								All currently set alarms can be found in the BBCalendar right click menu, and can 
								be selected to test that alarm. If there are no alarms, then it will display 
								"no set alarms" as the menu title name.

								If a configuration file for some reason (e.g. you deleted it &lt;g&gt;) can not 
								be found at startup (BBCalendar will first search for it in the same directory as 
								the plugin, then in the Blackbox directory), BBCalendar will automatically create 
								one for you in the same directory as the plugin.&nbsp;&nbsp;Most settings are 
								configurable from the menu.&nbsp; All number values and .wav file settings must 
								be done manually in the .rc file.

								<P>
									Please note that BBCalendar automatically saves the current running configuration 
									when you quit or restart Blackbox, overwriting the previous contents of the 
									file. If you want to change these values and make BBCalendar read them again, 
									edit the file, then save the file, and then select "Reload Settings" from the
