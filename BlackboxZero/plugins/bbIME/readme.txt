  bbIME 0.1 by Noccy
  A plugin to change the input language
  
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  WHAT IS THIS?
  
    This plugin listens to a set of broams to modify the input language
    selection in Windows 2K/XP.
    
    
  HOW DO I USE THIS?
  
    Use bbKeys to set up the hotkeys to call the broams.
    
  
  WHAT ARE THE BROAMS?
  
    @bbIME.NextLanguage
    @bbIME.PreviousLanguage
    
  
  WHAT ELSE IS THERE?
  
    Nothing. You can change the language for the active application. That's 
    it. Nothing fancy :)
    
    
  CREDITS?
  
    Based on lswitch by... someone :-)
