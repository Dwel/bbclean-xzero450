[changed 06/11/03 nc-17]
- bbstyle will turn trans off when going into the slit, but automatically turns
  it back on if it was set before when leaving the slit.

[previous updates for 0.25+ (higher means more recent) nc-17]
more crash fix attempts...think i've got it now
added icon to about box (thanks mortar)
now supports the xoblite/future bb4win beginPluginEx
forgot to add slit_remove message on plugin exit, fixed that :)
fixed folders being interpreted as styles, i hope
stopped alt-f4 closing bbstyle window
added border toggle (kinda nice for the slit sometimes)
writes rc settings on any change, no longer when plugin unloads
now rereads rc settings on reconfigure
setting transparency no longer makes the window disappear
improved deletion of GDI objects so should prolly cause less problems on 9x/me :) (thanks grishka)
window disappearing in slit on style change fixed
inherit toolbar height fixed in slit (thanks tres`ni)
edited about box (thanks manneeaack)
now slitable.
tweaked multiple wallpaper implementation
now only one dll needed for 9x/me/nt/2k/xp (thanks grishka)
